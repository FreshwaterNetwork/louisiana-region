Much of what we know about these species comes from concerted sampling efforts by The Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, universities and other researchers.  The Aquatic Species Mapper provides a watershed centric view of existing Fish and Mollusk sampling data.  Discreet sample data has been aggregated to watersheds by totaling all species found in each watershed.  Each species is then exported as a new layer comprised of the watersheds from which it has been recovered.  We also have “All Species” layers that show all the species that have been found within each watershed.  Individual species layers are not an indication of habitat range of the species, but a reflection of where sampling has occurred and can be used to identify data gaps.<img src='img/A_oxyrhynchus.png'></p>",
